# About Me
Hi! My name is Justin Park and I am currently a senior in high school attending Bergen Tech!
This repository is something that I am doing to keep track of the things that I am learning at my internship.

## Internship

### Python coding
```sh
name = "Justin"
language_learning = "Python"

print(f"Hello! I am {name}. Currently I am learning {language_learning}.")
```
The output should be 

```sh
Hello! I am Justin. Currently I am learning Python.
```
